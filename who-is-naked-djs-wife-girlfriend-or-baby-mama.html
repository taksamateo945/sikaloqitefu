However, he is currently in a romantic relationship with Kayleigh Schwark. Naked DJ’s girlfriend is a fellow reality TV star and semi-professional footballer.</strong></p><h2><strong>Naked DJ’s Girlfriend is </strong><strong>Kayleigh Schwark, a </strong><strong>South African Reality TV Star&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Naked DJ, whose real name is Quinton Masina, first crossed paths with Kayleigh Schwark in late 2019 after the former parted ways with his second wife. One thing led to another, and the two became so close. Since then, they’ve remained inseparable.</p><p>Naked DJ and his girlfriend haven’t been so open about their relationship. However, the latter recently mentioned that her boyfriend had lost the romantic spark he once had and that they had to seek professional help.</p><p>While the radio host believes no relationship is perfect, many people have labeled his relationship with Schwark as ‘toxic.’ In fact, a lot of people think they’re not compatible in any way.</p><p>Masina’s girlfriend also revealed that he is the most unromantic man she has ever seen and is very awkward in showing affection. Regardless, the two are still going strong together, and their relationship has grown stronger.</p><p>It’s not clear if they have plans to settle down as husband and wife in the future.</p><h3><strong>A 12-Year Gap Exist Between the Celebrity Couple</strong></h3><p>Naked DJ and Kayleigh’s age gap is another reason most people believe they are not meant to be together. The former is 12 years older than his girlfriend. Schwark was born on the 4th of December 1994 in Midrand, Gauteng, while Naked DJ’s parents gave birth to him in Benoni, Gauteng, on the 12th of August 1980.</p><h2><strong>Naked DJ and Kayleigh Starred Together on a Netflix TV Show</strong></h2><p>Schwark and her beau showcased their artistic abilities on the Netflix reality TV show <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Young, Famous, and African</a>, which debuted in March 2022. The two proved on the show that they are insanely talented and can create more beautiful projects.</p><p>Amongst other things, the African reality television series also explored the two-time divorcee and his girlfriend’s relationship, including the challenges they’ve encountered in their dating life and their 12-year age gap.</p><p>Schwark’s popularity soared after she joined the show – thanks to her impressive performance and ability to flow with other actors, which in every sense, was top-notch. Their fans are already looking forward to the pair working on more TV shows in the nearest future.</p><p>Other notable people in the show include&nbsp;South African actress and media personality <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Khanyi Mbau</a>, Diamond Platnumz, Zari Hassan,&nbsp;Nigerian model Annie Macaulay-Idibia, her musician husband 2Baba, Nigerian fashion stylist Swanky Jerry,&nbsp;South African rapper <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nadia Nakai</a>, and South African broadcaster <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Andile Ncube</a>.</p><h3><strong>Naked DJ’s Girlfriend, Kayleigh Schwark, Has Mixed Ethnicity</strong></h3><p>Naked DJ’s girlfriend comes from a multi-racial background. She was raised by her parents alongside her only sister Tracey Lee Julius who works with the Jonahhesburg-based leading tax firm VAT IT as VAT Team Leader.</p><p>Although she hasn’t revealed the identities of her parents, it is said that her father works at a local shop while her mother is a dutiful housewife and a great cook. Besides being a socialite, model, and fitness enthusiast, Kayleigh is an amazing footballer.</p><p>Schwark has played football in the Sasol Women’s League as well as for the Luso Africa Football Club. She frequently uploads pictures and videos to her social media accounts showing her practicing, playing football, and working out.</p><h2><strong>Naked DJ’s First Attempt at Marriage Was With Bubelwa</strong></h2><p>Bubelwa is the name of the first wife of Naked DJ. The two got married and spent a couple of years together before eventually calling it quits. One interesting about their divorce was that they finalized the process without publicity.</p><p>Bubelwa was raised away from the spotlight. Even after her marriage to the celebrity radio host, she kept a low profile on their marital relationship and personal life. Since the two divorced, nothing has changed.</p><p>Naked DJ’s ex-wife is still unknown to the public, making it even more difficult to keep a tab on her life and current whereabouts. Some time ago, Bubelwa made a shocking revelation about her ex-husband on Naked DJ’s twin sisters’ reality show ‘Blame it on Fame.’ She disclosed that the reality TV star was a sex addict who demanded sex many times a day.</p><h2><strong>His Second Marriage Crashed After Two Years&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Naked DJ and his second ex-wife Naledi Willers got married in 2017 and divorced two years later. Willers announced their divorce on social media many months after their separation.</p><p>She, however, did not mention the reason they ended their marriage. By the time she shared the post, she indicated that they had already separated permanently. Apart from being known as Naked DJ’s ex-wife, Naledi was also known to many people as one of the stars of the reality television series, The Real Housewives of Johannesburg.</p><p>She starred in season 1 of the show, which premiered on M-Net’s rebranded channel, 1Magic, on 3 August 2018. She was the life of the party on the show, and in the course of the show, she and other cast members visited her hometown Botswana for her mother’s 50th birthday in a private jet.</p><h3><strong>Naledi Lost Her Battle with Breast Cancer in December 2021</strong></h3><p>Naked DJ’s second wife passed on the evening of 7th December 2021 from complications of breath cancer. Naledi, who was very open about her cancer journey, was diagnosed with stage two triple-negative breast cancer in November 2019.</p><p>She kept fighting and being vocal about cancer awareness until two years later, when she lost the battle. Willers was a TV personality, model, actress, qualified Chef, lawyer, breast Cancer activist, and public speaker.</p><p>The Botswana-born beauty queen died at the age of 30.</p><h3><strong>Does the Metro FM DJ Have a Baby Mama?</strong></h3><p>Naked DJ has no baby mama, but he has only one child, a son named Peezy. He had him with his first ex-wife, Bubelwa. Sadly, the birth details and whereabouts of the younger Masina are not available for public consumption, and his other lives a super-private life.</p><p>Since Quinton rose to prominence, he has been in three known relationships, including his current affair with Kayleigh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK%2BYpHqqv4ynmKSdlGKxq7%2BMsKCfnV2ctrO4xaugnqaUYryzecGambJlnZa6ons%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jamal-adeen-thomas-parents-meet-his-mother-and-father.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meet His Mother Kathy and Father Clarence</a>
