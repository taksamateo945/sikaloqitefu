Her family was not financially wealthy but was emotionally close.</p><p>Both Obama and her brother were academically able and were able to skip an entire grade. She attended Whitney M. Young Magnet High School before enrolling at Princeton University.</p><p>After graduating with a degree in sociology, she went on to attend the prestigious Harvard Law School. She soon began working in a law firm and met Barack Obama, an intern who she had been asked to mentor.</p><p>Though she was not immediately receptive to his romantic advances, the couple ultimately began a relationship and married in 1992. She left her career in law, instead choosing to focus on more public-facing roles.</p><p>She first worked alongside Richard Daley, the Chicago mayor, as his assistant, and quickly became the assistant commissioner for the city’s planning and development. In 1996, her husband ran for Senate for the first time, and she balanced supporting his campaign with her own career.</p><p>The two welcomed their first child, Malia in 1998, and their second daughter, Sasha, followed in 2001. She became a working mom, sitting on the board of the University of Chicago’s Laboratory Schools and the Chicago Council.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Obama Presidency and Subsequent Role</h2><p>In 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president, Michelle Obama became first lady, the first African-American woman to hold the title.</p><p>As first lady, she launched several initiatives. To tackle childhood health issues, she created ‘Let’s Move!’, a scheme which encouraged children to eat healthily and exercise.</p><p>She was also instrumental in initiatives that aimed to improve education and employment opportunities for both military veterans and young people.</p><p>In 2018, the year following the end of Obama’s presidency, she released ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Becoming</a>’, a memoir about her life. In the week following its publication, 1.4 million copies of the book were sold.</p><p>The memoir’s publisher <a href=# rel=noopener>describes</a> it as “A work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling…a deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations.”</p><p>In an interview with Oprah, she discusses the book, saying that she began thinking about her life following her family’s departure from the White House. “We moved at such a breakneck pace from the moment we walked in those doors until the moment we left,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>recalls</a>.</p><p>In their new home, however, she “Had time to start thinking about those eight years.”</p><p>In 2020, a one-off Netflix <a href=# rel=noopener>documentary</a> was released which explored her life and followed her on her book tour.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Capricorn Zodiac Sign</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Capricorns</a> are thought to be driven individuals who take advantage of all the opportunities that come their way. The goat is used as the zodiac symbol, representing the strong-willed <a href=# rel=noopener>nature</a> and determination to continue climbing.</p><p>They’re thought to enjoy holding a high status, socially or professionally, and are happy to work hard to achieve this. Though they tend to aim high, they also have a realistic outlook on life and can sometimes be too focussed on the negatives they experience.</p><p>To reach their goals, they’re believed to be strict with themselves, with good levels of self-control. Although, despite this, they retain a soft side and can be emotionally sensitive.</p><p>Their interests often include puzzles and reading, as a way to challenge themselves and acquire new knowledge, ultimately to help them pursue their ambitions. They also tend to be interested in finances, as this is a simple way to assess how successful they become.</p><p>Usually, they get on well with people who have the Taurus or Virgo zodiac signs.&nbsp;</p><p>Other famous Capricorns include Dolly Parton, the actor Bradley Cooper and Zayn Malik of the band One Direction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBuucicn56knJp6sK7AppisZaqksaqtwmaqop%2BeZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./iferg-19990907-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Astrology Birth Chart of iFerg (YouTube Star) 2024</a>
