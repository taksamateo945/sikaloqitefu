They couldn’t wait to complete their high school journey before tying the knot in 1971. Their marriage eventually crashed after a decade but not before the birth of their son, Jamal, who came in 1973.</p><h2><strong>Who is Jamal Adeen Thomas’ Mother?</strong></h2><p>The name of Jamal Adeen Thomas’ mother is Kathy Grace Ambush.

She grew up alongside six siblings – four biological (Benjamin Ambush, Karen Thande, Reverend Stephen Ambush, June Ambush) and two step-siblings (Valarie Wilson and Sydney Schuyler) from her father’s second marriage to Mary Estelle.</p><h3><strong>Kathy’s Academic Pursuit</strong></h3><p>Jamal Adeen Thomas’ mother grew up in her place of birth, Worcester, Massachusetts, where she enrolled at Marian Central Catholic High School. In pursuit of higher education, the mother of one later joined an only girl’s college in Worcester.</p><p>Much later in life, Kathy decided to go for a University degree, a decision which led her to join Lincoln University. At the end of her studies, she earned a degree in business administration.</p><h3><strong>Jamal’s Mum has Worked in Different Organizations</strong></h3><p>Armed with a college degree, Kathy Ambush went to look for employment at The Immigration Learning Center, Inc., where she worked for a short while. Next, Milton Academy’s Massachusetts Advanced Studies Program employed her services as a Director.</p><p>With time, she became the Community Relations Manager at BankBoston and Kathy has put in quality time as an Occupation Volunteer with her alma mater, Lincoln University. Also, she has something to do with the Global Internet Entrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Who is Jamal’s Father, Clarence Thomas?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/02/R-e1676655290212.jpg><p>Jamal Adeen Thomas’ dad is Clarence Thomas. He was born on June 23rd, 1948, to a domestic worker named Leola “Pigeon” Williams and M. C. Thomas, who earned his keep as a farm hand. Clarence is currently 75 years old. His family lived in Pin Point, Georgia, very close to Savannah, and are said to be descendants of slaves who spoke Gullah as their mother tongue.</p><p>Clarence has two siblings – a brother, Myers Lee Thomas, and a sister called Emma Mae Martin. M.C Thomas was an absentee father during his children’s formative years, and Clarence had to go and live with his grandfather in the Gullah community – a very poor enclave near Savannah.</p><p>Born into a strong Catholic family, Clarence was brought up to uphold the Catholic faith. He sincerely wanted to join the Catholic order of priesthood but couldn’t stand the excessive racism he encountered then.</p><p>Jamal Adeen Thomas’ father later enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross and later went for his Juris Doctorate at Yale Law School.</p><h3><strong>Clarence Thomas is a Big Name in the American Judiciary</strong></h3><p>In the American judiciary, names like Clarence Thomas needs no introduction. The iconic American Jurist is an Associate US Supreme Court Justice. The former president of the United States, George H. W. Bush, nominated him as a replacement for Thurgood Marshall following his retirement in the early 1990s.</p><p>Ascending to his current position distinguished Jamal Adeen Thomas’ father as the second Black American to ever serve on the Court. Besides, Anthony Kennedy’s retirement in 2018 bestowed Clarence with the title of the court’s longest-serving member. He is currently the oldest justice since Stephen Breyer recently retired in 2022.</p><p>With his law degree, Clarence went to work in Missouri in his capacity as an assistant attorney. He later went on to experiment with private practice by working under Senator John Danforth as his legislative assistant.</p><p>When he went back to work for the government, Clarence gradually rose through the ranks, and today, he is one of the top guns in the American judiciary. Despite the level he has attained in academics, Clarence is a great believer in good manners over education.</p><h2><strong>Does Jamal Adeen Thomas Have a Relationship With His Father, Clarence?</strong></h2><p>Jamal Adeen Thomas enjoys a great relationship with his dad. Clarence Thomas was the one who got custody of Jamal after his divorce from Kathy, and he went ahead to give him the best of life.</p><p>Clarence was talking about the birth of his only son when he narrated how becoming a father left him with an intense sense of love plus responsibility. Baring his soul, the American Jurist revealed how he entertained fear upon hearing that he was about to become a father. Still, the birth of Jamal provided the solution to all his misgivings.</p><p>Clarence raised Jamal as a single father until he clocked 18 before the judge married his second wife, Virginia Lamp. It was not easy for the American lawyer at the initial stage as he was not earning enough for luxuries. However, Clarence swore to send his son to a private school to save him from the embracement he faced from racists during his days in public institutions.</p><p>Through sheer hard work and pawning his only care, Clarence was able to fulfill his dream of seeing Jamal Adeen Thomas through private schools, and according to the father of one, he is proud of his son’s achievements. Clarence never misses an opportunity to profess his undying love for Jamal, and the American judge has said that he would love his only child till eternity.</p><p>Nothing has been said about Jamal’s relationship with his mum, Kathy, however, some sources maintained that mother and son had constant contact even though he grew up with his dad.</p><h2><strong>Jamal Adeen Thomas’s Parents Got Married in 1971</strong></h2><p>The parents of Jamal Adeen Thomas legalized their relationship in a wedding ceremony that happened on the 5th of June 1971 at All Saints Episcopal Church.</p><p>The duo met in high school sometime in 1969, thanks to a mutual friend who introduced them. The couple was barely two years into their relationship when they had the only child of their union Jamal. After giving birth to Jamal, Clarence and Kathy didn’t have any other kids. Rather, the American Jurist took up the responsibility of training his great-nephew Mark Martin Jr who he raised alongside his only son.</p><p>Clarence and Kathy lasted only 10 years in their marriage before it hit the rocks in 1981. However, their divorce proceeding was a protracted one that came to a conclusion in 1984<br>Post-divorce, Clarence got married to Virginia Lamp, aka Ginny, and Kathy is currently the wife of a man known as Douglas Allen Smith.</p><h3><strong>Why Did Jamal Thomas’ Parents Get Divorced?</strong></h3><p>Jamal Adeen Thomas’ parents never explained what led to their divorce, but there are online sources claiming that Kathy once accused Clarence of cheating with a lady called Lillian McEwen; McEwen confirmed this allegation through her memoir.</p><p>She also labeled her ex an alcoholic; Clarence himself has also confirmed this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLeiucClZJqclZq7bsDHqKSaq12lrrOxza2qZqWVmsFutMisZKanpJ2ys3nAp5tmnpGptaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./braunwyn-windham-burke-bio-age-husband-kids-family-height-net-worth-house.html>&#171;&nbsp;Braunwyn Windham-Burke Bio, Age, Husband, Kids, Family, Height, Net Worth, House</a>
