Julianna met her late husband when he was on a trip to Puerto Rico, and sources state that the couple was <a href=# rel=noopener>married </a>for 40 years.</p><h2>Julianna Farrait’s net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Julianna has an estimated <a href=#>net worth</a> of approximately $1.5 million from her illicit dealings, a stark difference from her and her husband’s combined net worth which was approximately <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$30 billion</a>. With their net worth, Julianna and her husband lived luxurious lives and showered each other with the most expensive gifts, but all that glitters is not gold.</p><h2>Did Frank Lucas know Bumpy?</h2><p class=align-left>Frank Lucas knew him. Ellsworth Raymond Johnson, known by his street name <a id=https://allhiphop.com/news/widow-of-harlem-og-bumpy-johnson-calls-frank-lucas-a-flunky/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bumpy </a>was an American crime boss from Harlem, New York, United States of America. He was born on 31 October 1905 in Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America. Bumpy was a mentor to Frank and he contributed to Lucas’s knowledge of operating in the crime industry. Furthermore, Frank served as Bumpy’s second-in-command.</p><h2>Is Bumpy Johnson still alive?</h2><p class=align-left>Bumpy is late.

He died in the arms of Junie Byrd, his childhood friend.</p><h2>Julianna Farrait now</h2><p class=align-left>Following her husband’s death, Julianna settled in New Jersey with her family. She has not been in the news making headlines since her husband passed away and as a result, she has kept a low profile. Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">absence </a>in the media has made <a href=#>people</a> question her specific whereabouts which remain unknown.</p><h2>Julianna Farrait’s social media profiles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a8b06d573a35bfac.jpg><p class=align-left>Julianna is not active on any social media platforms and the reasons for this could be her age and the illegal dealings she has been involved in, which could have brought her unwanted attention and cyberbullying.</p><h2>Is Frank Lucas’s wife still alive?</h2><p class=align-left>Her absence from the media and unknown situation makes it difficult to know whether or not she is still <a href=#>alive</a>. Sources confirming her death or that she is still alive are yet to be found.</p><h2>Beauty queen Julianna Farrait</h2><p class=align-left>There are several articles on the internet that describe Julianna as a former beauty queen, however, there are not many details about when she started her beauty pageant journey and what titles she won.

His efforts to get the drug lord nabbed succeeded in the 1970s and saw Frank being handed a 60-year prison sentence.
