Aug. 13 episode saw Leah Messer struggle to convince her husband, Jeremy Calvert, to stay with her after he threatened divorce.</p><p>Here’s what happened:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Jenelle Evans</strong></p><p>Tensions bubbled to the surface when Jenelle’s fiancé, <strong>Nathan Griffith</strong>, suspected she was cheating on him. During an alcohol-fueled fight, he screamed, “You’re f—king trailer trash who won the lottery,” and stormed out of the room.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, the unpredictable Nathan announced he was going on a business trip to Atlanta to talk about opening a gym — a project Jenelle had never heard of before. She didn’t believe him and he wouldn’t give her any details on where he was or where he was staying.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we do break up, it’s like, I have two babies from two different baby daddies,” Jenelle told her friend. “How would I find a guy that would even accept me? I would be a burden to them. I want me and Nathan to work it out.”</p><p>Nathan surprised her by texting Jenelle that he was at his Atlanta hotel, then walking in the door moments later. He was grinning from ear to ear and giggling about something, but Jenelle was confused. He couldn’t give a straight answer on what he had done or how long his drive was. &nbsp;</p><p>“Is it me or does he seem hyped the f—k up?” Jenelle asked her friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Later Jenelle questioned Nathan about his trip, and he shouted, “It was the best two days of my entire life because there was no yelling.”&nbsp;</p><p>The volatile couple started fighting again and Nathan asked for his engagement ring back, which Jenelle refused to give.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t want to be with you, Jenelle,” he screamed. “You are a sociopath! You are a psycho. I just wish you would give me my ring back.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll take it off before I go out tonight,” a sassy Jenelle quipped before heading out the door, carrying their baby son, <strong>Kaiser</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Chelsea Houska</strong></p><p>Chelsea’s master plan to team up with<strong> Taylor</strong> against her ex, <strong>Adam Lind</strong>, has backfired. It turned out Adam had reached out to Taylor and they had been talking about custody of their daughter, <strong>Paislee</strong>, out of court.&nbsp;</p><p>“I found out Adam talked with Taylor so I don’t know what she’s going to do,” Chelsea told her friend. “I don’t care what people do, but if that’s going to mess with my court case, I’m not going to be happy.”</p><p>Chelsea and Taylor decided to meet up so their two daughters could spend some time together. As <strong>Aubree </strong>and Paislee were painting, Chelsea began to ask Taylor about her custody hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was one of those things where I heard him out and told him I’d think about it,” Taylor said, avoiding Chelsea’s pointed gaze. “I never gave an actual for sure answer.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Adam seemed pretty smug about the situation while talking to his pal.&nbsp;</p><p>“Taylor called me and said she wanted to settle out of court,” he said. And when his friend asked if he’d get back together with Taylor, he replied, “Yep, right away.”</p><p>Chelsea’s once seemingly set court case was now looking like it might rule in Adam’s favor, despite his checkered past.&nbsp;</p><p>“Seeing that me and Taylor are perfectly fine, the judge isn’t going to give me less of what I have now because they’re sisters,” Adam said of his two daughters. “He’s not going to want to split sisters apart. There’s no way I’m going to walk out of that courtroom without custody. It just isn’t going to happen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong></p><p>Kailyn had her hands full fighting to save her marriage and worrying about her ex <strong>Jo Rivera</strong> moving to Delaware to be closer to their son,<strong> Isaac</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>“The bright side is Isaac not being in the car for six hours. But we don’t need to be neighbors,” Kailyn warned Jo.&nbsp;</p><p>But Jo was the least of her problems. As she and her husband, Javi Marroquin, prepared for a trip to Florida with Kailyn’s friends, the mother of two was seriously stressing about Javi and his jealous temperament.&nbsp;</p><p>“You like to be very needy while I’m gone,” Kailyn told Javi. “I feel like every time I try to do something, you ruin my time. I need to give you time and attention that you need, but you also don’t need to be ruining trips and affecting my friendships with people because it is healthy for me to have relationships with people outside of the marriage.”</p><p>When Javi admitted he didn’t want Kailyn’s friend <strong>Sterling</strong> to come on the trip, Kailyn blew up at him in the car.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought you were going to let it go and be an adult!” she shouted at him.&nbsp;</p><p>This only caused the pair to get into a heated argument while driving down the interstate. In a scary moment, Javi collided with a piece of wood on the side of the road, and had to pull over after they got a flat tire.&nbsp;</p><p>The frightening accident caused Javi to confide in his sister, who had some sage wisdom. She urged the young father to work things out or risk losing his wife and kids. The conversation seemed to work and Javi talked it out with Kailyn.</p><p>“If I expect this marriage to get better, then I need to fix the things that I have done wrong and then we can help each other grow instead of tearing each other apart,” Javi told a surprised Kailyn. “I really do want to change and I really do want to take a step back. I do apologize and I do want to work on myself because I want to make this marriage work.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Leah Messer</strong></p><p>It was the beginning of the end for Leah and her husband, <strong>Jeremy Calvert</strong>. Well, actually, the end seems to have been coming for quite some time. Leah admitted to having a spending problem and blowing through the money that Jeremy was earning on his pipe job, which required him to be away from home often.&nbsp;</p><p>When Leah called him asking about a bank account, he declared on the phone, “That’s not my problem anymore. You’re blowing through money like f—king water. Don’t start s—t with me, Leah.”</p><p>“You’re saying that I’m not your responsibility! I’m not even doing anything! My God, what is wrong with you?” Leah cried.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m filing for divorce,” Jeremy threatened. “I’m not f—king around this time.”</p><p>At first, Leah didn’t seem concerned by Jeremy’s words.&nbsp;</p><p>“He does it all the time,” she told her friend. “I can’t tell you how many times he’s thrown his ring at my face. I do have a spending problem. I need to work on it. I have anxiety. I have depression. That’s an issue.”</p><p>A fed-up Jeremy confided in his friend about his impending divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>“The house looks like a homeless shelter,” he exclaimed. “All hell broke loose when I got my own bank account. She takes prescription medicine for her anxiety. I don’t know if that s—t’s f—king with her or not. It’s obvious she has some addiction issue. I don’t know if she would intentionally put the kids in harms way, but as far as not paying attention or not thinking clearly, then something taking place, I can see that happening right now. The girl I fell in love with ain’t the girl I got now.”</p><p>Things got even worse when Leah was forced to spend her wedding anniversary alone. The tearful mom was at her wits’ end on the milestone day, crying to her friend, ”It bothers me because it feels like he regrets getting married, he regrets having a kid, he regrets marrying a woman with two kids. You can’t force somebody to stay with you. And I don’t even care that it’s two divorces under my belt because if he don’t love me he don’t love me. But it would f—king break my heart.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy stayed away for two weeks before returning to his parents’ house. He then asked if Leah will drop off their daughter, <strong>Addie</strong>, so he could spend some time with her. The estranged couple came face to face in a parking lot as Leah tried to hold it together and Jeremy looked indifferent.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just want you to get help,” he told her. “You can’t love me if you don’t love yourself.”</p><p>“I love myself,” Leah stammered. “I loved myself until you’re going through all of these issues…”</p><p>Trailing off, an emotional Leah rushed to her car and drove away. She began to sob, talking to herself as the MTV cameras captured the upsetting moment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He doesn’t know,” she cried. “He was never there. Anytime I tried to talk to him, he was never there.”</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> What did you think of tonight’s episode of Teen Mom 2?</p><p>Teen Mom 2 airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on MTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrZyepl2ivK55kWapnpuRpXqtscChZKado6iys3nHrqqbmZ6ZeqK%2FyqxknaGmpL%2BksYxrZ2ptYWmF</p></div><div id=links><a href=./up-on-the-accelerator-slow-down-a-bit-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;___ up on the accelerator (slow down a bit)</a>
